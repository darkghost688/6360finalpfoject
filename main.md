Project

Each group of one to three students will complete a research project , and you will present your results in a final report and oral presentation. Your group will conduct an investigation of a question of interest to you by applying the data science techniques. Rather than collect primary data, you will use data available on the Internet or from faculty research. During the last week of class, you (and your group) will give a 15 minute oral presentation of your study.

Example of past project:
