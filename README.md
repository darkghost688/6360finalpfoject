# Final Project

git clone 
open nifH.ipynb

run the code:

```python
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn biopython
```


## Final Project by zhiwen zhong
*  FINAL Project: "Organize Biological Data through the model built project"
*  
We have spent the semester learning:
* the philosophy of data science and linux
* how to control a computer from the command line
* the basics of 3 computer languages that are critical in processing, analyzing, and visualizing biological data
  * `bash`
  * `R`
  * `python`
* version controling our work using git
* distributing our work using GitHub
* the final project that professor want is we can organize Biological Data by this class
* so just build a model try to use the sequenced genes


# * Main purpose
### Organize Biological Data by models created based on the 20 nifH genes data to predict which species of the sample belong to.


* Download the data from :
NCBI

and through 5 different models to predict the accuracy.
